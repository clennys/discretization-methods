\section{Odd vs. Even Method}
In this exercise, we compared the accuracy of two spectral differentiation methods, the Odd and Even Fourier methods. The function $u(x)= \exp(k \sin(x))$ and its derivative were used to compare the two techniques. The Table below summarizes the minimum number of grid points $N$ required to achieve the maximum error of $10^{-5}$ and the corresponding maximum relative errors for increasing values of the parameter $k$.

The numerical evidence show that the Even method consistently outperforms the Odd method in terms of accuracy, by requiring less grid points to achieve a similar relative error. As an example for $k=4$ the Even method achieves a significant lower maximum relative error. Furthermore the Even method needs most of the time 2 to 4  less grid points to fall below the required error threshold.\\
In conclusion, the EVEN Fourier method proves to be more reliable across and is preferable when high accuracy is required with fewer grid points.
